--- Story ---

You take the lift down to investigate explore place. Of course,
given how old it is, it stops unexpectedly. A moment later, the
lift starts falling down, then crash!

The lift's vibrations destroy the last remaining stability of
the pipes, busting them open!

To make matters worse, the whole place is weird and unstable.
There's acid everywhere from the years of being left alone! And
more is flooding in!

Now you must find an exit before the whole place floods!
